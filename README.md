# Mock-Game-Website
This is the very first website I created uisng HTML/CSS, it is meant to be a mock website for a game I used to play as kid. It helped me understand the basics of HTML
but mainly CSS. The main aim with this exrescise was to teach my self how to position divs where I want them. Which was challenging at the beggining but I quickly
picked up the basics.
